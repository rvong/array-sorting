# array-sorting
Java (Eclipse project)

Sorting Algorithms:
Selection Sort
BubbleSort
CombSort
ShakerSort
InsertionSort
ShellSort
MergeSort
QuickSort

Hybrid:
Use Insertion sort for very small n <= 100 arrays to speed up sorting for O(n log n) sorting algorithms with higher constant factor (QuickSort, MergeSort).
InsertionMergeSort
InsertionQuickSort

Also times Java's built-in sorting algorithms:
Arrays.sort() Dual pivot quick sort for primitive types. Merge sort for Object types.
Arrays.parallelSort() Multithreaded sort-merge.

To do:
Generalize to Object (Templates)
Distribution Sorts (Counting, Bucket, Radix)
